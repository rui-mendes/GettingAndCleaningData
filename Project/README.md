Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This repository contains the material for the course project "Getting and Cleaning data" from Coursera, part of the Data Science specialization.

Goal
------------
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The goal is create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
 
+ Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
+ Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
+ Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
+ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
+ Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Dataset
------------
The datasets is based on Human Activity Recognition. The full description and the data can be found
